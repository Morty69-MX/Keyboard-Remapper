# Key Remapper for StepP1-Plus (KR)

This is a simple [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (v2) script that remaps keyboard keys to match the controls of the dance game `stepp1-plus-2.0.0`.

## How to Use

1.  **Install AutoHotkey:** Download and install **version 2.0** or higher from the [official AutoHotkey website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2.  **Run the Script:** Double-click the `kr.ahk` file to start it. The script will run in the background.
3.  **Toggle On/Off:** Press the `Caps Lock` key to toggle the remapping at any time.
    *   A **low-pitched sound** indicates that remapping is **ON**.
    *   A **high-pitched sound** indicates that remapping is **OFF**.

## Key Mappings

When the script is **active**, the following mappings are applied:

### Game Panels
